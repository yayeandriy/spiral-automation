Below is an **onboarding questionnaire** – seven questions structured as JSON‑style objects so they can be directly embedded in a survey UI or a chatbot flow.  \nEach item contains:\n\n* `id` – a short identifier  \n* `question` – the prompt  \n* `options` – a list of answer choices (including “Other,” which opens a free‑text field)\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"workflow\",\n    \"question\": \"What does your current blade‑inspection workflow look like?\",\n    \"options\": [\n      \"Manual positioning + hand‑held caliper measurement\",\n      \"Semi‑automated: manual positioning + camera capture\",\n      \"Fully automated: robot arm + integrated camera & calipers\",\n      \"Other – please describe\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"measurement_points\",\n    \"question\": \"How many measurement points does your blade usually require?\",\n    \"options\": [\n      \"1–3 (basic dimensions)\",\n      \"4–6 (intermediate detail)\",\n      \"7–10 (full geometric profile)\",\n      \"More than 10 (specialty parts)\",\n      \"Other – please specify\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"tolerance\",\n    \"question\": \"Do you compare live measurements directly against CAD tolerances?\",\n    \"options\": [\n      \"Yes – fully integrated\",\n      \"Yes – manual comparison after data export\",\n      \"No – we use generic tolerance bands\",\n      \"Not sure – can you explain our current comparison method?\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"data_capture\",\n    \"question\": \"How is measurement data currently stored and used?\",\n    \"options\": [\n      \"Saved locally on a workstation (CSV, Excel)\",\n      \"Loaded into a custom enterprise database\",\n      \"Exported to a cloud analytics platform\",\n      \"Captured only for quality control, then discarded\",\n      \"Other – explain\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"quality_verification\",\n    \"question\": \"Which verification methods do you employ?\",\n    \"options\": [\n      \"Single‑method: only optical or only mechanical\",\n      \"Dual verification: optical + mechanical simultaneously\",\n      \"Statistical process control with built‑in SPC\",\n      \"No verification – rely on operator judgment\",\n      \"Other – specify\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"integration\",\n    \"question\": \"Which manufacturing or ERP systems integrate with your inspection workflow?\",\n    \"options\": [\n      \"MES (Manufacturing Execution System)\",\n      \"ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)\",\n      \"LIMS (Laboratory Information Management)\",\n      \"None – standalone operation\",\n      \"Other – list the system(s)\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"improvements\",\n    \"question\": \"What are the biggest pain points you face during blade inspection?\",\n    \"options\": [\n      \"High setup time for each part\",\n      \"Accuracy drift over long sequences\",\n      \"Data logging inconsistency\",\n      \"Insufficient real‑time feedback\",\n      \"Need for clearer statistical insights\",\n      \"Other – describe\"\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThese questions are designed to surface:\n\n1. **Workflow maturity** – manual vs automated.  \n2. **Measurement granularity** – number of points.  \n3. **Tolerance integration** – CAD‑driven validation.  \n4. **Data handling** – storage, accessibility.  \n5. **Verification approach** – single vs dual methods.  \n6. **System integration** – MES/ERP connections.  \n7. **Pain points** – areas ripe for improvement.\n\nFeel free to adjust the wording or add hidden fields to capture free‑text responses for the “Other” options.

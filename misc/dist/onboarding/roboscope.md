    - Foreign inclusions (debris, contamination)
    - Resin-rich or resin-starved areas
    - Ply positioning errors
    - Surface scratches or damage
    - Root fitting alignment issues
    - Leading/trailing edge defects

6. **What spatial accuracy is required for defect positioning?**
    - ±1mm (high precision)
    - ±5mm (standard precision)
    - ±10mm (general positioning)
    - ±25mm (approximate location)

7. **What is your current inspection workflow?**
    - Manual visual inspection only
    - Manual with basic measurement tools
    - Some digital documentation (photos/notes)
    - Existing quality management system integration
    - Paper-based reporting
    - Mixed manual and digital processes

8. **How many technicians typically perform inspections?**
    - 1-2 technicians per shift
    - 3-5 technicians per shift
    - 6-10 technicians per shift
    - More than 10 technicians per shift
    - Varies by production schedule

9. **What is your inspection frequency and volume?**
    - Every blade (100% inspection)
    - Batch sampling (e.g., 1 in 5 blades)
    - First article inspection for new models
    - Problem-driven inspection (when issues arise)
    - Continuous monitoring during production

10. **What lighting conditions are available in your facility?**
    - Excellent (>1000 lux, consistent)
    - Good (600-1000 lux, mostly consistent)
    - Variable (lighting changes throughout day)
    - Poor (<600 lux, inconsistent)
    - Needs assessment

11. **Do you need integration with existing systems?**
    - ERP system (SAP, Oracle, etc.)
    - MES (Manufacturing Execution System)
    - Quality management system
    - Document management system
    - None required

12. **What are your primary pain points with current inspection processes?**
    - Inconsistent defect assessment between technicians
    - Time-consuming documentation and reporting
    - Difficulty tracking defect locations precisely
    - Poor traceability and data retention
    - Communication delays between shifts/teams
    - Lack of standardization across facilities

13. **What mobile devices do your technicians currently use?**
    - Company-provided smartphones (iOS)
    - Company-provided smartphones (Android)
    - Personal smartphones (mixed platforms)
    - Tablets (iOS/Android)
    - No mobile devices currently

14. **What is your target timeline for implementation?**
    - Immediate (within 1 month)
    - Short-term (1-3 months)
    - Medium-term (3-6 months)
    - Long-term (6+ months)
    - Evaluation phase only

15. **What is the scale of your deployment?**
    - Single production line
    - Multiple lines in one facility
    - Multiple facilities/locations
    - Pilot program first, then scale
    - Enterprise-wide rollout
